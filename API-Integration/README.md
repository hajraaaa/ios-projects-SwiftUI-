# API Integration using CRUD Operations
This iOS app is built using SwiftUI and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations by interacting with a third-party API. The app fetches data from a RESTful API using URLSession and allows users to perform operations on that data in a user-friendly interface.

## Features
1. **MVVM Pattern:** Clean architecture for better separation of concerns.
2. **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete data using the API.
3. **Data Fetching:** Fetch data from a third-party API using URLSession.
