# UsersList App
UserListApp is an iOS app built using SwiftUI that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. Users can add new users with unique details, view their information, and update their details as needed. The app uses SwiftUI for the user interface and State Management to keep track of the users' data.

1. **Add User:** Add new users with unique names, email addresses, and other details.
2. **View User Details:** View details of a selected user in a dedicated detail screen.
3. **Update User:** Edit the information of an existing user.
4. **Delete User:** Remove a user from the list.
5. **State Management:** The app uses @State and @Binding properties for managing user data across views.
6. **Unique User Identification:** Each user has a unique identifier.
