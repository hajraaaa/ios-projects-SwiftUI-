# UserApp
UserApp is a SwiftUI-based iOS app that demonstrates dynamic UI updates and state management. The app features a Toolbar that changes its color dynamically based on the user’s selection. When a user taps an item, it navigates to a Detail Screen where users can view additional information. The app uses SwiftUI's State Management to track the selected item and handle navigation seamlessly.

## Features
1. **Toolbar with Dynamic Color Change:** The toolbar’s color changes based on the user’s selection.
2. **Navigation to Detail Screen:** When the user taps an item, the app navigates to a detailed view of the selected item.
3. **State Management:** The app uses SwiftUI's @State and @Binding properties to manage data and state throughout the app.
4. **Back Navigation:** The user can navigate back from the detail screen using the default SwiftUI back action.
